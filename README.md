## FigRs - Visualizing the Elements of Risk-Based Decisions in R

(FigRs is part of the [SOLV Online Resources](http://www.solv.ca/OnlineResources.html)) 

FigRs collects the R code for custom graphs and illustrates 
lessons learned from using R-based graphs in collaborative planning processes.

The step of bringing quantitative information into a broader group is tricky, 
and small changes in layout can make a big difference 
(e.g. getting R to write out full numbers instead of scientific notation).

Pulling together the material for this site also serves as a gentle nudge 
to polish up graphs that were frequently thrown together in the middle of a workshop, 
clean up the R scripts, and compile an inventory of R tricks that we've used.










R Code for Plots on www.solv.ca/FigRs

This repository has a library of custom plotting functions and scripts with worked examples.

CUSTOM FUNCTIONS  -----------------------

perc.rank() - imitates Excel's percentrank() function

per.rank.plot()  - various plot options using perc.rank()

ts.plot() - fancy formatting for a basic time series plot

sens.range.plot() - prototype plot showing outcome ranges for simulation runs (scenario x range x simtype)

bubble.plot () - prototype plot showing a moving bubble chart

ETC ETC


EXAMPLE SCRIPTS --------------------------
