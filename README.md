## FigRs - Visualizing the Elements of Risk-Based Decisions in R & Shiny

(FigRs is part of the [SOLV Online Resources](http://www.solv.ca/OnlineResources.html)) 

The step of bringing quantitative information into a large group is tricky, 
and small changes in layout can make a big difference. FigRs collects 
code for custom graphs and illustrates 
lessons learned from using R-based graphs in collaborative planning processes.

FigRs covers 3 types of examples:

- [*Plots*](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FigRs/tree/master/Shiny%20Apps): standard plots for presentations, handouts, and reports
- [*Shiny Apps*](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FigRs/tree/master/Plots): interactive tools
- [*3D Prints*](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FigRs/tree/master/3D%20Prints): turning data into tangible objects

FigRs is also building an inventory of reference materials on the [wiki page](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FigRs/wiki).
