## 3D Print Design 1: Time Series on a Base

Last Updated: August 29, 2013

Challenge: Convert a data series into a surface which can then be further processed into a 3D object for printing.


Solution: Set up a grid of square cells, and specify 
heights to describe spikes based on the data series, 
plus a base so that the final printed object can stand up. 

Use the custom function below to create your own, write to FigRs(at)solv.ca and suggest a time series, or get one of the examples from our online store.


Worked Examples:
   * [Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2]()   
   * [El Nino Events (Nino4 Series)]()   
   * [Station ALOHA pH and Temperature]()   
   * [Lynx Cycles - Mackenzie Region 1821 to 1934]()
   * [Fraser Sockeye Salmon Cycles]()
